# odin-recipes

This project is a website for a company that makes available cooking recipes
on the internet for free viewing. 

Succefully completing this website will prove my recently learned knowledge on the basics
of html through the odin project. It will also prove my solid understanding of github and git - including commiting and describing properly my commits.
